<p>Welcome to the bulker registry. At the moment, this is a barebones server that provides a few in-house manifests for you to test with bulker. In the future, we envision this as a full-featured RESTful API with a user interface to allow you to identify and download existing manifests, as well as share your own environments with others. 
</p>

Manifests are divided into namespaces. You can browse available manifests by choosing a namespace below:

<ul>
<lh>Namespaces:</lh>
<li><a href="databio">databio</a></li>
<li><a href="bulker">bulker</a></li>
</ul>
