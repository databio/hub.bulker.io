<h1>Bulker registry</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the bulker registry. We're currently hosting the bulker registry on github pages. At the moment, this is a barebones server that provides a few in-house manifests for you to test with bulker. In the future, we envision this as a full-featured RESTful API with a user interface to allow you to identify and download existing manifests, as well as share your own environments with others.

You can browse available manifests at the repository on github:
