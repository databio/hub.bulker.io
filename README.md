Welcome to the bulker registry. At the moment, this is a barebones server that provides a few in-house manifests for you to test with bulker. In the future, we envision this as a full-featured RESTful API with a user interface to allow you to identify and download existing manifests, as well as share your own environments with others. 

Manifests are divided into namespaces. Each subfolder in this repository is a namespace.

You can link to this manifest by adding this line to your bulker config file:

```yaml
registry_url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databio/hub.bulker.io/master/
```
